# PiControl
PiControlâ„¢ is a dashboard for managing OpenElec/Kodi based TV controllers over WebSockets.

It is designed for use with TV's operating as electronic signage, digital billboard or a digital kiosk.

We use Raspberry Pi 2 based devices as a cheap and effective controller, but you can use any OpenElec/Kodi supported hardware.

## Features
* Dashboard displaying a screenshot and details of what is playing on each controller.
* Connection handling and auto-reconnect of multiple WebSocket connections.
* Refresh button - reboots the controller.
* Notify button - displays on-screen notification on controller's TV.
* Skip button - plays next item in playlist / skips the current playing item.
* Content recognition - recognises several media types including video, pictures, music and TV and returns details of what is playing.
